▪ Created a secure VPC environment with both public and private
subnets, ensuring proper network segmentation and access controls.
▪ Deployed and managed EC2 instances across private and public
subnets, optimizing performance, security, and scalability.
▪ Created a bastion host in the public subnet to securely manage and
access the EC2 instances in the private subnet.
▪ Implemented load balancer to evenly distribute traffic across multiple
EC2 instances in the private subnet and integrated auto-scaling to
dynamically adjust instance capacity based on demand, ensuring high
availability, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
